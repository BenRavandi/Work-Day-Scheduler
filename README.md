# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a simple daily planner application that allows users to save events for each hour of their typical working day (9am-5pm). They can add their important events to this planner so that they can manage their time more effectively. This calendar has time-block colors meaning the past, present and the future events on the day will be displayed with different colors to better clarify the events. 

## Planner Application Usage

- The current time is displayed on top of the application
- Users can add their events on the calendar for the different time of the day
- Time-blocks are colored based on past, present and future time to better assist users with their events
- Users are able to save their events by clicking the save buttton at end of each time-block
- Users can change or delete the events as well, but they need to save the updated events in order to keep the latest change
- A short temporary message will be shown on top of the planner each time an event is saved
